# Upskill-Campus---QueuLess
QueuLess is a smart, user-friendly queue management system with real-time token updates, voice alerts, and priority handling. Built using PHP, MySQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for efficient service flow and enhanced user experience.

 Staff Login Features:
☐ Staff members have a dedicated login page. There’s no need to register — login credentials are pre-set in the system.
☐ They can easily switch between light and dark themes to suit their preference.
☐ Once logged in, staff can call the next user in queue with a single click on "CALL NEXT". A sound alert plays, and the user’s status updates from "waiting" to "called".
☐ After the user has been attended to, clicking "MARK AS SERVED" updates the status to "served".
☐ Want to check all patients? Use the "VIEW ALL PATIENTS" option — it shows everyone waiting in line.
☐ Download patient details as an Excel file. Use date and time filters to find specific records with ease.
☐ The "VIEW ANALYTICS" feature displays insightful charts and statistics on token bookings — a handy tool for understanding user flow.
☐ There's also a "VIEW FEEDBACK" section, where staff can read all submitted feedbacks, see the total number of responses, and view the average rating.
☐ Staff can even manually set the average service time — this helps calculate both the estimated waiting time and total time needed to serve all remaining users.
☐ Every page includes a live clock, plus intuitive Home and Back buttons for smooth navigation and a better UI/UX experience.

User Login Features:
☐ New users need to register first, then they can log in using their email and password.
☐ They can toggle between Tamil and English, and also choose between dark or light mode for a personalized feel.
☐ The "PROFILE" section shows user details and past visits. All this information can be downloaded for records.
☐ On the dashboard, users can see:
The number of people waiting
Their own position in the queue
And the average waiting time
☐ To join the queue, users click "BOOK TOKEN". If it's an emergency, they can opt for an Emergency Token, which gets top priority.
☐ When an emergency token is booked, all users in the queue get an instant alert — both visually and with a sound notification.
☐ Need to cancel? Users can cancel their token anytime — they’ll be removed from the queue instantly.
☐ After service, users can submit feedback through the "GIVE FEEDBACK" option to share their experience.
☐ They can always check their current status — whether they're waiting, called, or served — right from the dashboard.

🎯 With these features, our system makes queue management smarter, faster, and more user-friendly — for both staff and users.
